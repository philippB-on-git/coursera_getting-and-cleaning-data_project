The description of the original dataset is provided below.

## Description of this analysis (processing)
### Getting data
The provided scrpit _run_analysis.R_ will check in the directory in which it is executed if the original dataset (_see below_) has already been downloaded and extracted. If not data will be downloaded ([Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)) and extracted.

The following files are then loaded:
* features.txt
* activity_labels.txt
* X_test.txt and X_train.txt
* y_test.txt and y_train.txt
* subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt

### Merging data
For both the _test_ and the _train_ datasets, the corresponding files are merged per row, where the first column contains the subject_id, the second column the activity_id. 
The merged train dataset is then appended to the merged train dataset. Next, the activity_labels are merged. The feature names from features.txt are used for the column names of the measurements. 

### The results
From the resulting dataset only the subject_id, the activity label and columns containing mean or std values of the measurements are extracted. The column names are reformatted to be more readible. A detailed description of the contained columns in the final dataset is provided in the ***code book**.

Finally, the dataset is then used for a summary of the data, calculating the mean value of each variable is calculated per subject_id and activity. This is the final result, which is written as *merged_data_summarized.txt* into the directory in which the script was executed.

## Description of the original dataset

(_see also_ http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
*'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

### Notes
* Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
* Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
